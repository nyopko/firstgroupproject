# Audio Rain

This application allows the user to recieve album suggestions based on the weather in their current location. It does this by connecting the weather ID from OpenWeather to a particular mood. Then, we connected the mood to a particular genre or "feeling" of music to suggest an album from MusixMatch.

The user will also get related artists returned to them, as well as, being able to see what album was recommended to the five most recent users prior to their search.
